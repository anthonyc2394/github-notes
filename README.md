### Git
Git is a piece of software that tracks changes in any set of files. It is commonly used to coordinate work among programmers who are collaboratively developing source code during software development.
### Github
GitHub is a website that allows developers and programmers to collaborate on code. The primary advantage of GitHub is its version control system (git), which allows for seamless collaboration without jeopardizing the original project's integrity.
### Repo
A repository is a directory or storage space where you can keep your projects. This is sometimes abbreviated as "repo" by GitHub users. It could be a folder on your computer or a storage space on GitHub or another online host. A repository can contain code files, text files, image files, and anything else you can think of.
### Commit
A commit, also known as a "revision," is a single change to a file (or set of files). When you commit to save your work, Git generates a unique ID that allows you to keep track of the specific changes made, as well as who made them and when. Commits typically include a commit message, which is a brief description of the changes that were made.
